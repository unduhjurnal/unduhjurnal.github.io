                        The Bear and The Two Friends<br />Once two friends were walking through the forest. They knew that anything dangerous can happen to them at any time in the forest. So they promised each other that they would remain united in any case of danger.<br />Suddenly, they saw a large bear approaching them. One of the friends at once climbed a nearby tree. But the other one did not know how to climb. So being led by his common sense, he lay down on the ground breathless, pretending to be a dead man.<br />The bear came near the man lying on the ground. It smelt in his ears, and slowly left the place. Because the bears do not touch the dead creatures.Now the friend on the tree came down and asked his friend on the ground, “Friend, what did the bear tell you into your ears?” The other friend replied, “The bear advised me not to believe a false friend.”Story of lion and his fear<br /><br /> There was a lion who feared nothing except the crowing of cocks.A chill would go down his spine whenever he heard a cock crowing.<br /> One day he confessed his fear to the elephant,who was greatly amused."How can the crowing of a cock hurt you?"he asked the elephant."think about it!".<br /> Just the a mosquito began circling the elephant head."If it get into my ear i'm doomed!"he shirieked,flailing at the insect with his trunk.Now it was the lion turn to feel amused.<br /><br />Moral value:If we could see our fears as others see them we would realize that most of our fears make no sense.<br />

                        Two Best Friends<p>             Once upon a time, in a village near the jungle, there were two poor best friends named Cleo and Patra. Every day, they went to the jungle to find fire wood to be sold. Cleo was  strong while Patra was quick and agile. Cleo could fell down a tree with one punch while Patra was able to cut the tree to small piece in very short time. They always helped each other and they get along together, and they were afraid of nothing.</p><p>One day they found a treasure map in the jungle. They were so surprised and Cleo invited Patra to find out the treasure.</p><p>“Patra look I got something such a treasure map” Cleo whispered.</p><p>“It just only a fake map, buddy. Don’t trust it” Patra Answered.</p><p>“You always think too short”. Cleo replied. “How about if we try to find it out tomorrow”? He invited.</p><p>“Hmmmm” Patra was thinking.</p><p>“If we are lucky we will be the richest men in this village. Like what we always dream” Patra said.</p><p>Okay. Patra replied.</p><p>. The next day Cleo and Patra went to find the treasure based on the map they had gotten. The map guided them to a cave. Then they went inside. After they had walked for hundred meters, they met two branches of tunnels -yellow and blue tunnel- in the cave. As their problem, there was not a direction about what the right tunnel in the map, so that they were confused to think which tunnel they should choose.</p><p>As a result, they began to debate. Cleo thought that blue tunnel was the right way, whereas Patra preferred to choose Yellow cave. Then they were insulting each other.</p><p>“Blue tunnel is the right way” Cleo said.</p><p>“But I have good felling with this yellow tunnel” Patra replied.</p><p>Then Cleo said “Your felling is hoax, just listen to me. I always better making decision than you”.</p><p> Patra was very angry hearing Cleo’s last statement and they fought. Finally they separated by choosing different tunnel to get the treasure. After that, each of them met big and spooky creatures who guarded the treasure. They were very afraid and felt so weak, so they run back while the creatures run after them until Cleo and Patra met again at the beginning of those tunnels.</p><p>  After they had met again, they felt to be strong again and together, they could defeat those creatures easily. Finally, they realized that they should not fight, because both of them had excesses and weaknesses each other and they could be strong together. Finally, they asked for sorry each other and be friend again while they became the richest men in their village since got the treasure.</p><br />

                        The Ant and the Dove<br /><br />One hot day, an ant was searching for some water. After walking around for some time, she came to a spring. To reach the spring, she had to climb up a blade of grass. While making her way up, she slipped and fell into the water. She could have drowned if a dove up a nearby tree had not seen her. Seeing that the ant was in trouble, the dove quickly plucked off a leaf and dropped it into the water near the struggling ant. The ant moved towards the leaf and climbed up there. Soon it carried her safely to dry ground.Not long after at that time, a hunter nearby was throwing out his net towards the dove, hoping to trap it. Guessing what he was about to do, the antquickly bit him on the heel. Feeling the pain, the hunter dropped his net. The dove was quick to fly away to safety.<br /><br />The morality: One good turn deserves another.<br />

                        The Goose and The Golden Eggs<br /><br />Once
 a farmer went to the nest of his goose and found there an egg, all 
yellow and shiny. When he picked it up, it was heavy as a rock. 1 He was
 about to throw it away because he thought that someone was playing a 
trick on him. 2 But on second thought, he took it home, and discovered 
to his delight that it was an egg of pure gold!<br /><br />He sold the egg 
for a lot of money. Every morning the goose laid another golden egg, and
 the farmer soon became rich by selling the eggs.<br /><br />As he grew 
rich, he also grew greedy. 6 “Why should I have to wait to get only one 
egg a day?” he thought. “I will cut open the goose and take all the eggs
 out of her at once.”<br /><br />When the goose heard the farmer’s plan, she
 fl ew away to a nearby farm. So when the farmer came out the next day, 
do you know what he found in the goose’s nest? 8 Nothing.<br /><br />Moral: 
Someone who wants more often loses all. When you want something, be 
patient. If you are greedy, you might lose what you already have.<br /><br /><br />Sidang Paripurna DPR adalah forum tertinggi di DPR. Hakekatnya adalah musyawarah-mufakat. Azasnya demokrasi. Semangatnya demi kesatuan dan persatuan bangsa. Karenanya, Paripurna yang pertama saat anggota dewan baru masuk, agendanya adalah membuat agenda. Istilahnya: tata tertib. Karena berasal dari proses konstituante yang sama, maka setiap anggota DPR adalah keterwakilan konstituen partai politik.<br />

                        <p>One day, a cat and a fox were having a conversation. The fox, who was a conceited creature, boasted how clever she was. “Why, I know at least a hundred tricks to get away from our mutual enemies, the dogs,” she said.</p><p>“I know only one trick to get away from dogs,” said the cat. “You should teach me some of yours!”.</p><p>“Well, maybe someday, when I have the time, I may teach you a few of the simpler ones”, replied the fox airily.</p><p>Just then they heard the barking of a pack of dogs in the distance. The barking grew louder and louder – the dogs were coming in their direction! At once the cat ran to the nearest tree and climbed into its branches, well out of reach of any dog. “This is the trick I told you about, the only one I know”, said the cat. “Which one of your hundred tricks are you going to use?”.</p><p>The fox sat silently under the tree, wondering which trick she should use.

They dwelled in an ocean.<br /><br />Once Sura and Baya were looking for some nourishment. Abruptly, Baya saw a goat.<br /><br />“Yummy, this is my lunch,” said Baya.<br /><br />“No way! This is my midday meal. You are greedy” said Sura. Then they battled for the goat. After several hours, they were very exhausted.<br /><br />Feeling exhausted of battling, they lived in the different places. Sura dwelled in the water and Baya dwelled in the land. The border was the sandy shore, so they would never battle afresh.<br /><br />One day, Sura went to the land and looked for some nourishment in the stream. He was very famished and there was not much nourishment in the sea. Baya was very furious when he knew that Sura broke the pledge.<br /><br />They fought afresh. They both hit each other. Sura bit Baya's tail. Baya did the same thing to Sura. He bit very hard until Sura eventually provided up and A went back to the sea. Baya was happy.<br />

One day, the boy joined in school and didn't have a time to spend with 
apple tree. After several days, the boy came to the tree. The apple tree
 was so happy to see the boy. It asked the boy to play.

<br />

Unfortunately, the boy said he was not a child anymore. He didn't want 
to play with  the tree. But he asked another request to  the apple tree.

<br />

The tree asked what the boy wanted. The boy said he needed toys, but his parents didn't have money to buy it for him.

<br />

The tree said, "Dear my boy, i don't have any money to buy it for you, 
but you can pick my apples, then sell them, get money and buy  the toys 
you want."

<br />

The boy went happily to his home after plucking apples. The tree was 
waiting to see the boy return. But he never came back for many years.

<br />

The apple tree was sad and it didn't produce any apples anymore.<br /><br />Recount : Fantastic Holiday<br />
Last summer I got a fantastic holiday. I visited some great places.<br /><br />
I went to an airport and was going to fly to Cleveland. I was spending 
there two days. I liked to see some Cleveland Cavaliers basketball 
matches.<br /><br />
Then I went to Hollywood. Hollywood is a famous district in Los Angeles,
 California, United States. It had become world-famous as the center of 
the film industry. Four major film companies – Paramount, Warner Bros., 
RKO and Columbia – had studios in Hollywood. I did not want to leave but
 I had to.<br /><br />
After that, I went to New York city. I visited the Statue of Liberty. I 
went from the bottom of Manhattan to the top of the crown. That was very
 amazing.<br /><br />
The places made me feel at home but I have to go home. Next time I would return to them.<br />Narrative text :

The Legend of Rawa Pening

Once upon a time, there was a little poor boy came into a little village. He was very hungry and weak. He knocked at every door and asked for some food, but nobody cared about him. Nobody wanted to help the little boy.

Finally, a generous woman helped him. She gave him shelter and a meal. When the boy wanted to leave, this old woman gave him a “lesung”, a big wooden mortar for pounding rice. She reminded him, “please remember, if there is a flood you must save yourself. Use this “lesung” as a boat”. The “lesung” was happy and thanked the old woman.The little boy continued his journey. While he was passing through the village, he saw many people gathering on the field. The boy came closer and saw a stick stuck in the ground. People challenged each other to pull out that stick. Everybody tried, but nobody succeeded. “Can I try?” asked the little boy. The crowd laughed mockingly. The boy wanted to try his luck so he stepped forward and pulled out the stick. He could do it very easily. Everybody was dumbfounded.

Suddenly, from the hole left by stick, water spouted out. It did not stop until it flooded the village. And no one was saved from the water except the little boy and the generous old woman who gave him shelter and meal. As she told him, he used the “lesung” as a boat and picked up the old woman. The whole village became a huge lake. It is now known as Rawa Pening Lake in Salatiga, Central Java, Indonesia.

I persuaded my father to teach me to ride " Honda 75 ". Firstly, my father refused my request and promised that he would teach me two or three years later, but I still whimpered. Finally, my father surrendered and promised to teach me.

He began to teach me riding the motorcycle around a field in my village. My father was very patient to give me some directions. I was very happy when I realized my ability to ride a motorcycle. " Yes, I can ".

One day later, when I was alone at home, I intended to try my riding ability. So, myself tried bravely. All ran fluently in the beginning, but when I was going back to my home and I must passed through a narrow slippery street, I got nervous. I lost my control and I fell to the ditch.

After that, I told my father about the last accident. I imagined my father would be angry and never let me ride again. But the reality is exactly on the contrary, my father was very proud of me. He just gave me some advices and since that accident, I got my father's permission to ride motorcycle.<br />

Set out before it gets hot, and when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will get nothing; and when you go into her room, don't forget to say, "Good morning", and don't peep into every corner before you do it.'<br /><br />     'I will take great care,' said Little Red Riding Hood to her mother, and gave her hand on it.<br /><br />     The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village, and just as Little Red Riding Hood entered the wood, a wolf met her.

"The Boy Who Cried Wolf"

There was once a young shepherd boy who tended his sheep at the foot of a mountain near a dark forest. 1 It was lonely for him watching the sheep all day. No one was near, except for three farmers he could sometimes see working in the fi elds in the valley below.

One day the boy thought of a plan that would help him get a little company and have some fun. 3 He ran down toward the valley crying, “Wolf! Wolf!”

The men ran to meet him, and after they found out there was no wolf after all, one man remained to talk with the boy awhile.

The boy enjoyed the company so much that a few days later he tried the same prank again, and again the men ran to help him.

A few days later, a real wolf came from the forest and began to steal the sheep. The startled 6 boy ran toward the valley, and more loudly than ever he cried, “Wolf! Wolf!”

But the men, who had been fooled twice before, thought that the boy was tricking them again. So no one came to help the boy save his sheep.

Dear Nan

<br />

            We are having a wonderful holiday
here in Gold Coast. Yesterday was great as we went to Movie World.

            When we got up in the morning it
looked liked rain. After a while the clouds disappeared and it became a sunny
day. We then decided to go to Movie World.

            First I went to Lethal Weapon. Next
I saw the Police Academy Show. After that I had lunch as I was really hungry.
Meanwhile, Mom and Kelly queued for the Batman ride.

            It rained about lunchtime but soon
it was fine again. We really enjoyed our holiday.

Bye-bye
